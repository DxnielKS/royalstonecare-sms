# Time to scale RSC's revenue

## Braindump
- the goal is to bring RSC to above 6 figures a year, so above 100,000 a year

## Components of the business
- fulfiment
    - carpet cleaning
    - stone cleaning
    - etc..
- marketing
    - inbound
        - website / landing page
    - outbound

customers pay a single fee for each job they hire us to do

to reach 6 figures a year, one or multiple of the following must increase

- the amount of customers that have jobs done for them, horizontal scaling
- extract and provide more jobs to existing customers, vertical scaling

to scale horizontally, you need to:
- improve marketing
    - inbound
        - improve websites SEO
        - increase the surface area of the companies presence online
    - outbound
        - cold
            - generate leads from big agencies that are high value
            - email campaigns
        - warm
            - offer referral discounts to existing customers

to scale vertically you need to:
- nurture and push marketing on existing customers to purchase more
    - sms campaigns to existing customers offering deals and holiday discounts

## KPI's
How do you know the progress of the business at any given points?

- KPI's
    - MRR
    - ARR
    - Jobs completed monthly
    - Wages
    - Chemical Expenses

Need to centralise data so that KPI's and relevant information can be synthesised and produced at any given moment.

### TODO
